Simple chat app with socket.io

Im using nodemon to get it up and running. Its set to start on port 4004.

Use npm install to get all dependencies or if you are using yarn just type yarn install.

Open a few windows of the same page and see how its working.

Nothing too much, i just built this to understand socket.io a bit more.
Really easy to build.

Im using Stylus for CSS. The latest compiled CSS is in /public/style.css
Commands for running are styles and styles:watch . Styles just compiles the CSS 
while watch watches for changes and recompiles on every change.
